## 💬 FAQ

**Q: How long to become productive?**
A: 1-2 weeks. After Chapter 1-2 + Exercises 1-2, you can write basic integrations.

**Q: Do I need to read everything?**
A: No. Use curriculum-summary.md to choose your path. You can skip chapters not relevant to your current work.

**Q: Can I use Kotlin/Scala?**
A: Yes! Camel works with any JVM language. Examples are in Java for clarity.

**Q: What about XML-based routes?**
A: Java DSL is recommended (and all examples use it). XML is covered briefly but deprecated in new projects.

**Q: Can I use this with my existing Kafka setup?**
A: Absolutely. Chapter 5 covers Kafka integration with Spring Boot.

**Q: How often is Camel updated?**
A: Quarterly releases. This guide covers 4.15+ (as of Jan 2026).

**Q: Where do I go if I have questions?**
A: Apache Camel docs (camel.apache.org), Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions.
